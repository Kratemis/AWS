# Step function
## Module objetive

This module is designed to provide a practical understanding of AWS Step Functions, a powerful tool for orchestrating microservices on the AWS cloud. Through a concrete example that processes a list of numbers and performs mathematical operations based on specific conditions (even and odd numbers), this module aims to:

- *Demonstrate the creation and configuration of state machines:* You will learn how to define and configure a state machine that coordinates multiple Lambda functions to perform specific tasks based on data input.
- *Teach the use of AWS Lambda in conjunction with Step Functions:* You will see how Lambda functions can be integrated to perform calculations and how their execution can be managed through Step Functions.
- *Illustrate integration with DynamoDB (WIP):* The module shows how to store processing results in a DynamoDB database, demonstrating effective cloud storage integration within orchestrated workflows.
- *Facilitate understanding of advanced flow control:* Through the use of conditional decisions and loops within the state machine, you will see how dynamic workflow management is handled in real-world scenarios.


This example is intended not only to offer an introduction to the basic functionalities of AWS Step Functions and Lambda but also to provide a foundation on which more complex and robust applications can be built. It is ideal for developers, solution architects, and anyone interested in cloud software engineering who wishes to delve into the automation and orchestration of processes on AWS.
